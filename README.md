- #### Mental Health friendly
  I have created a web-based application, called Mental Health Friendly, which serves as a community for people dealing with psychological issues. On this website, users can access a page with a list of psychological tests and can click on a link to take the test from an external website. Users are also allowed to post or view stories about individual's mental health journeys, classified and filterable by specific mental health concerns. Furthermore, users are allowed to request for counselling, and users with a background in psychology or some experience in mental health and counselling can volunteer as counsellors on the website and have permissions to view all requests and accept requests.

- #### capstone
  I have created a web-based application using Django called "ForMaternity". The aim of which is to provide pregnant women with information and guidence to help them get through pregnancy healthily. The app allows users to track their pregnancy(by indicating how far along they are by updating the weeks depending on the week of pregnancy they provided when they started to track the pregnacy on the app and the date), users (those registered as pregnant) have access to perinatal health information including nutrion, pregnancy weight gain guidelines and are able to track their weight gain journey throughout pregnancy utilising the quidelines and a pregnancy weight gain calculator, in addition, they are able to request a consultation appointment with Dieticians and/or Counsellors (The app allows users to register as Perinatal Dieticians and Counsellors). The users registered as dieticians and counsellors have access to the requests pages for diet-consultation and counselling, respectfully. Dieticians and Counsellors also have permission to accept and attend to the requests. Another feature is for pregnant women, which includes a checklist of common prenatal tests categorised based on the trimester which they are performed.
