- #### Mental Health friendly
  I have created a web-based application which serves as a community for people dealing with psychological issues. On this website, users can access a page with a list of psychological tests and can click on a link to take the test from an external website. Users are also allowed to post or view stories about individual's mental health journeys, classified and filterable by specific mental health concerns. Furthermore, users are allowed to request for counselling, and users with a background in psychology or some experience in mental health and counselling can volunteer as counsellors on the website and have permissions to view all requests and accept requests.
